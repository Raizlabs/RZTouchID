 *  RZTouchIDDelegate allows you to provide a custom mechanism for storing the identifier (typically representing a user) associated with the password you are storing and protecting with touch ID.

 *  
 *  Be aware that if the mechanism you use is replicated to the cloud the identifier might persist onto other devices but the keychain might not. In this case the user would experience login failures and have to manually enter the password.
